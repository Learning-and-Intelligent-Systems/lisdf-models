## Contributing

You can't directly push to the `main` branch. All contributions will require review to ensure we are not breaking anything and following conventions.

1. Add your new models to the `models/` directory
2. Create a new Git branch
4. Commit and push your changes on that branch to GitHub
5. Create a GitHub Pull Request (PR) and ask someone to review it
   - Note you will need at least one approval to merge your PR.
6. Get approval :shipit: and merge into `main`!
